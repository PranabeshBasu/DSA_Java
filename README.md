## 🚀 My DSA & Java Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step journey of mastering **Java and Data Structures**, starting from core fundamentals and gradually moving toward structured problem-solving and clean coding practices.

- **Basics** – Building a strong foundation in Java syntax, control flow, and logic
-  **Patterns** – Improving logic and loop control through pattern problems  
- **BasicMaths** – Strengthening problem-solving using mathematical concepts
- **BasicArrays** – Understanding arrays, traversals, and common patterns  
- **OOPBasics** – Learning object-oriented programming principles in Java  
- **Collections** – Exploring Java Collections Framework for efficient data handling  

Each folder represents a milestone in my learning process, reflecting consistent practice and conceptual growth as I prepare for placements and real-world development.
